  <li>how could multi-label classification improve the usability of the bear classifier?
    <blockquote>
      <p>It could predict when there is no bear present, and not only restrict to the 3 classes</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How do we encode the dependent variable in a multi-label classification problem?
    <blockquote>
      <p>One hot encoding with MultiCategoryBlock</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How do you access the rows and columns of a DataFrame as if it was a matrix?
    <blockquote>
      <p>df.iloc[r,c]</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How do you get a column by name from a DataFrame?
    <blockquote>
      <p>df.column or df[‘column’]</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between a dataset and DataLoader?
    <blockquote>
      <p>a dataset is a list of x,y tuples. A dataloader takes a dataset and creates + shuffles mini-batches</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What does a Datasets object normally contain?
    <blockquote>
      <p>a list with 2 lists. One list is of the x input, and the other list contains the y inputs</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What does a DataLoaders object normally contain?
    <blockquote>
      <p>List of Minibatch lists of (x,y) tuples</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What does lambda do in Python?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Shorthand way to create functions on the fly</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What are the methods to customise how the independent and dependent variables are created with the data block API?
    <blockquote>
      <p>get_x, get_y. You put in your functions base on what the dataloader input data is (eg image path vs df)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Why is softmax not an appropriate output activation function when using a one hot encoded target?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Softmax tries to maximize one output. If we have multiple labels/targets, then softmax might push labels out</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Why is nll_loss not an appropriate loss function when using a one hot encoded target?
    <blockquote>
      <p>nll_loss is for single label datasets where that target is labeled as a single integer and not one-hot encoded</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is the difference between <code class="highlighter-rouge">nn.BCELoss</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss</code>?
    <blockquote>
      <p>first one does not do a sigmoid. Second one performs a sigmoid on the activations.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Why can’t we use regular accuracy in a multi-label problem?
    <blockquote>
      <p>accuracy used predictions from the highest class, and only had 1 output. Whereas, multi-label probles have multiple outputs, and we need to check the accuracy for each class separately
we will separately sigmoid each class, threshold, and then compare to target labels</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>When is it okay to tune an hyper-parameter on the validation set?
    <blockquote>
      <p>when the validation set accuracy sweep curve is flat -&gt; generalizes</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>How is <code class="highlighter-rouge">y_range</code> implemented in fastai? (See if you can implement it yourself and test it without peaking!)
    <blockquote>
      <p>y_range gives you the min and max range. Sigmoid squishes input between 0 and 1.
Now, you just need to change the range -&gt; sigmoid(x)<em>(max-min)
Recenter -&gt; sigmoid(x)</em>(max-min) + min</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What is a regression problem? What loss function should you use for such a problem?
    <blockquote>
      <p>a regression problem is where the labels/targets are continuous variables. Use absolute difference or mean squared loss</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>What do you need to do to make sure the fastai library applies the same data augmentation to your inputs images and your target point coordinates?
    <blockquote>
      <p>Inside datatablock -&gt; blocks=(ImageBlock, PointBlock) , Pointblock lets FA know the labels are coordinates, and to perform the same augmentation as the image</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
